        'Lender Zap allocates incoming deposits 90% to cSAI and 10% to dLETH2x.',
        'Therefore, if you send 1 ETH to this Lender.DeFiZap.eth, or buy from our website, 0.9 of your worth will go towards investing in Compound.Finance while 0.1 of your ETH will be used to open a Perpetual ETH Long with 2x leverage.',
        "Lender's Zap is interesting because, within a year, the interest generated from cSAI could completely cover your margin trade purchase. Think of it as trading with your future interest earned.",
        'After sending your ETH, you will immediately receive allocated tokens (cSAI+dLETH2x) which track your DAI lending balance + margin trade position. Once you receive these tokens you can visit Compound.Finance to view/withdraw interest earned and Fulcrum.Trade to view your ROI/ close position on dLETH2x.'
